Default ENV
- Nginx_PORT=8080
- Nginx_PROXY_PORT=22333
- Nginx_PROXY_PATH=downloads

You can change the Nginx_PORT to coordinate with your service provider.

You can also modify Nginx_PROXY_PORT & Nginx_PROXY_PATH, and the Bear Server's config file also need to be matched with these two ENV virable too.
